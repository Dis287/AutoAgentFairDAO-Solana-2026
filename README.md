## Proof of Origin & Timestamp
- **Repo created & first detailed commit**: February 5, 2026  
- **Commit hash for initial enhanced README**: oa4cda3... (view full history for exact SHA)  
- **Concept documented**: An AI agent-run fair launch DAO on Solana – fair bonding curve launch (no presales, equal access) + autonomous no-code/low-code agents for anti-rug enforcement, milestone burns, treasury votes, and 24/7 governance.  
- This predates any identical or highly similar public implementations in the Solana AI agent + fair launch DAO/meme ecosystem as of early 2026.

# AutoAgentFairDAO-Solana-2026

**Concept & No-Code MVP Timestamp: February 5, 2026**

## Vision
An **AI agent-run fair launch DAO** on Solana:

- Token launches fairly (no presales, bonding curve via Pump.fun / DAOs.fun / BONKfun style – equal access for all, bot-resistant where possible).
- Post-launch: Autonomous AI agents (built with no-code/low-code tools like OpenClaw, Solana Agent Kit, Griffin AI, or n8n workflows) enforce rules and manage governance 24/7:
  - Anti-rug measures (timelocks, dev wallet restrictions, milestone-based burns/airdrops)
  - Treasury execution based on DAO votes
  - Real-time monitoring and autonomous actions (e.g., auto-burn on supply thresholds)

This remains largely untapped in the Solana meme/DAO ecosystem as of early 2026 – combining fair launch mechanics with persistent agent autonomy for "rug-proof" community-driven projects.

## Why Solana?
- Ultra-fast & low-cost transactions
- Dominant meme launch ecosystem (Pump.fun family, Raydium integration)
- Growing AI agent tooling (SendAI Agent Kit, vvaifu.fun, etc.)

## No-Code MVP Roadmap
1. Fair token launch → Pump.fun / DAOs.fun / CoinChef  
2. DAO governance layer → Tally / Snapshot / ArmaDAO wizard  
3. Basic agent enforcement → n8n automation or Griffin AI agent connected to votes/actions  
4. Persistence & autonomy → Run agent on VPS/local with wallet integration  

Idea originated & timestamped here first on February 5, 2026.  
Open to forks, discussions, and collaborative building.
